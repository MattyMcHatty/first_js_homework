// Episode 1
const scenario = {
    murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
    room: 'Library',
    weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

//This should return 'The murderer is Scarlet.' Const is being used here for variables and a function but since
//there is not attemp to change any of these at any point beyond the initial assignment it shoudl run without issue.


// // Episode 2
const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

//This will throw up an error as soon as it trie to call the ChangeMurderer function since murderer has already been delcared a const


// // Episode 3
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);

// 'First Verdict: The murderer is Mrs. Peacock' because statement has been created and return from inside a function using a let variable.
// 'Second Verdict: The murderer is Professor Plum' Because the murderer variable has not been changed outside the function.


// Episode 4
let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);

// 'The suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard' as this string has been returned to the const suspects.
// 'Suspect three is Mrs Peacock.' Because let suspectThree = 'Mrs Peacock' . The actual value was never returned from the previous
// function.


// // Episode 5
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
}

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);

'The weapon is the Revolver' The const scenario can be changed because it is an object. Therefore all the functions play out as 
expected.


// Episode 6
let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function () {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

'The murderer is Mrs. White.' let murderer is declared outside the functions so it's scope allows it to be changed by those
functions.


// Episode 7
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

    const unexpectedOutcome = function() {
      murderer = 'Miss Scarlet';
    }

    unexpectedOutcome();
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// 'The murderer is Mr. Green' The first thing the function changeMurderer does it set murderer to 'Mr. Green'. Inside plotTwist
// murder is set as a let, and therfore everything that happens within that function, including in the unexpectedOutcome function
// isn't passed out.


// Episode 8
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Mrs. Peacock',
  room: 'Conservatory',
  weapon: 'Lead Pipe'
};

const changeScenario = function() {
  scenario.murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  scenario.room = 'Dining Room';

  const plotTwist = function(room) {
    if (scenario.room === room) {
      scenario.murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';
    }

    const unexpectedOutcome = function(murderer) {
      if (scenario.murderer === murderer) {
        scenario.weapon = 'Candle Stick';
      }
    }

    unexpectedOutcome('Colonel Mustard');
  }

  plotTwist('Dining Room');
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);

// 'The weapon is Candle Stick.' Because the const scenario is an object it can be changed. So if you follow the logic through the
// function this is how it will evaluate.


// Episode 9
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// 'The murderer is Professor Plum' the if loop does nothing because it sets murderer as a let inside the loop, therfore that value
// won't come out of it.
